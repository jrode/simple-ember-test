# Simple Ember Test

A sample project for getting started with basic Ember syntax and conventions.

## What this covers

There are three major pieces to the modern Ember ecosystem:

1. [Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) - The framework itself.
2. [Ember Data](https://github.com/emberjs/data) - The data modeling library.
3. [Ember CLI](http://www.ember-cli.com/) - The utility that adds build tools, project structure, and addons. 

This guide focuses on just the first one, Ember.js itself, to provide some real-world examples without bombarding newcomers with multiple libraries and tool chains.
